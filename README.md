## 😄 Fun Fact

Did you know that the second 'e' in Remindeer is silent? That's right! Despite its spelling, Remindeer is actually pronounced just like "reminder." We thought it would be fun to give our deer mascot a little extra "e" to make it stand out. So, don't be surprised when your friends pronounce it differently! 🦌🤷‍♀️
